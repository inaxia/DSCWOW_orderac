## Description
We know that during this COVID time many industries are failing to grow as they were growing before.<br>
But some are growing faster than ever before.<br>
And one of them is **Food industry**.

Whenever we go to a **mall**, the very first things we find is crowd, especially in **Food Courts**.<br> 
There are more people standing in a food court than the people having a seat and eating their food.

We are creating an App & a Website, which people can use to **order food directly** from our app from anywhere **inside the mall**, rather than standing in a queue to order their food.<br> 
And the website will be available to the food courts from where food courts can see their respective list of orders.

- This will decrease the crowd in the food courts
- This will make the food ordering process faster
- Food courts will get more orders as user don't have to stand for very long
- This can be implemented in every mall
